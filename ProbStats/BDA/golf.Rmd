Note. Andrew Gelman has uploaded this example as a [case study](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/golf.html), rendering this notebook redundant.

The following graph shows data on the proportion of successful golf putts as a function of distance from the hole. Unsurprisingly, the probability of making the shot declines as a function of distance:

```{r}
g
```

How can we model the probability of success in golf putting as a function of distance from the hole? The usual statistical practice would indicate that we need to use a logistic regression:

$$
\begin{align}
&p_j = \text{logit}^{-1}(a + bx_j) \\ \\
&y_j \sim \textsf{binomial}(n_j, p_j)
\end{align}
$$

```{r, comment=""}
readLines("programs/golf_logistic.stan") %>% 
  writeLines()
```

```{r, results="hide"}
golf_data_list <- with(golf_data, list(
  dist = x, 
  n = n, 
  success = y, 
  J = nrow(golf_data)
  ))

golf_logistic <- stan("programs/golf_logistic.stan", 
     data = golf_data_list)
```

```{r}
print(golf_logistic, probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height = 3}
posterior_logistic <- extract(golf_logistic)

df_logistic <- as_tibble(posterior_logistic) %>% 
  gather(a, b, key = "parameter", value = "estimate")

df_logistic %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, fill = parameter)) + 
  geom_density(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~parameter, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "posterior density")
```

Note that this model doesn't actually fit the data really well. For starters, the probability of success isn't predicted to be 1 when the distance is zero! This point isn't sufficiently emphasized: with enough data, we can obtain very precise estimates from a wrong model.

```{r}
invlogit <- function(a, b, x) {
  linpred <- a + b*x
  1 / (1 + exp(-linpred))
}

g_logistic <- g
for (i in sample(4000, 200)) {
  g_logistic <- g_logistic + 
    stat_function(fun = invlogit, 
                  args = list(
                    a = posterior_logistic$a[i], 
                    b = posterior_logistic$b[i]), 
                  alpha = 0.01, color = "pink")
}

g_logistic + 
  stat_function(fun = invlogit,
                args = list(
                  a = mean(posterior_logistic$a),
                  b = mean(posterior_logistic$b)
                  ), linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Logistic regression")

```

**Modeling from first principles**

As an alternative to logistic regression, Gelman builds a model from first principles. The graph below shows a simplified sketch of a golf shot. The dotted line represents the angle within which the ball of radius $r$ must be hit so that it falls within the hole of radius $R$. This threshold angle is as follows:

$$
\theta = \sin^{-1} \left(\frac{R-r}{x}\right)
$$

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.cap="golf diagram", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/golfpicture.png")
```

The next step is to model *human error*. The golfer is attempting to hit the ball completely straight but  many small factors interfere with this goal, so that the actual angle follows a normal distribution centered at 0 with standard deviation $\sigma$.

The probability that the ball goes in the hole is then the probability that the angle is less than the threshold:

$$
p_i = 2 \Phi \left(\frac{\theta_i}{\sigma}\right) - 1
$$

where $\Phi$ is the Normal cumulative distribution function (centered at zero). Note that the angle $\theta$ is the *only* random variable in this model and that $\sigma$ is the only parameter that we actually need to estimate.

**Note**. This formula is equivalent to the following:

$$
p_i = 1 - 2 \Phi \left(- \frac{\theta_i}{\sigma}\right)
$$

*Why do we use a normal distribution?* Because we are aiming at zero and there are many contributing additive factors that skew the ball one way or the other. We could have also used a $t$-distribution, which is just a *mixture* of normal distributions with different variances (e.g. some players are better than others, some courses are easier, and so on).
