Most of this notebook comes straight from Susan Holmes and Wolgang Huber's [__Modern Statistics for Modern Biology__](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/index.html) [-@holmes2018modern, chap. 1-2].

The difference between probability and statistical inference is succintly described by [@wasserman2013all]:

- __Probability:__ _Given a data generating process, what are the properties of the outcomes?_

- __Statistical Inference:__ _Given the outcomes, what can we say about the process that generated the data?_
