## Introduction

- There's one main idea that runs through calculus: __the infinity principle__. "To shed light on any continuous shape, object, motion, process, or phenomenon -no matter how wild and complicated it may appear- reimagine it as an infinite series of simpler parts, analyze those, and then add the results back together to make sense of the original whole".

- Calculus succeeds were other forms of reasoning fail by proceeding in two phases: cutting (__differential__ calculus) and reassembling (__integral__ calculus).
